# COVID-19 Global Impact Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to uncover trends and insights related to case counts, death rates, vaccination progress, and socioeconomic correlations. Using publicly available datasets, the analysis highlights differences across countries and regions, accounting for population size and other key factors.

## Objectives
- Examine the global distribution and impact of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
- Investigate variations in death rates and their possible causes.
- Analyze vaccination progress and its relationship to mortality.
- Identify patterns in infection waves across different regions.
- Explore correlations between COVID-19 metrics and socioeconomic indicators.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Plotly Express (optional, for interactive plots)
- IPython.display (for displaying images in Jupyter Notebook)

## How to Run/View the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python 3 and required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (analysis.ipynb) to explore the data and visualizations.

4. Alternatively, run the Python scripts (analysis.py) to reproduce the analysis.

5. Images and charts generated during the analysis are available in the images/ folder.

6. For detailed insights, see the insights.txt file.

## Insights and Reflections
1. Large countries tend to have the highest total COVID-19 case counts, but when adjusting for population, smaller countries often show higher relative impact.

2. Death rates vary widely, influenced by healthcare systems, demographics, and other factors beyond healthcare quality.

3. Vaccination coverage is uneven globally, with wealthier countries achieving higher rates faster, contributing to reduced mortality.

4. Infection waves exhibit distinct temporal patterns across regions, reflecting varying policy responses and variant spread.

5. Socioeconomic factors correlate with testing and vaccination rates, but also with reported case numbers, highlighting the role of testing capacity in understanding pandemic metrics.
