1. Overview of Global Burden
Our analysis of global COVID-19 data reveals a disproportionate distribution of cases and deaths across countries.

Nations with large populations—such as the United States, India, and Brazil—contribute the highest raw case totals.

However, after normalizing by population (cases per million), smaller nations sometimes show a heavier impact, underlining the need for per capita metrics in cross-country comparisons.

2. Mortality Outcomes and Influencing Factors
Mortality rates due to COVID-19 vary considerably by country.

Even countries with advanced healthcare systems report high death rates, suggesting that other variables—such as response timing, age distribution, and policy effectiveness—play key roles.

The correlation heatmap in our notebook indicates strong associations between death rates and variables like median age, hospital bed availability, and GDP per capita.

3. Disparities in Vaccine Coverage
Vaccination rollout has not been uniform globally.

Our bar and pie chart visualizations show that high-income countries generally achieved broader and faster vaccine coverage.

Countries with limited economic resources tend to lag significantly behind.

The scatter plots suggest a moderate inverse relationship between vaccination rates and death rates, although causality cannot be established due to confounding variables such as variant emergence and healthcare access.

4. Temporal Trends and Infection Waves
Time-series analysis using 7-day rolling averages reveals regional and temporal variation in the spread of COVID-19.

Most countries experienced multiple infection waves, though the timing and magnitude of these waves differed.

Factors such as travel restrictions, seasonal effects, and variant spread likely contributed to these differences.

5. Socioeconomic Indicators and COVID-19 Metrics
Our correlation matrix reveals meaningful links between COVID-19 metrics and socioeconomic variables.

Countries with higher GDP per capita and HDI typically report more cases and higher testing rates, which may be attributed to better data infrastructure and broader test availability.

These countries also tend to have higher vaccination coverage, pointing to the importance of economic capacity in pandemic response.
